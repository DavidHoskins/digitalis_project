# Running project
Running the project requires 2 steps for the backend to work correctly

## run celery:
This needs to be run for scheduled tasks, advised that this should be run first.
celery -A rest_api worker --loglevel=INFO

## run django:
This needs to be run to deploy the backend restful endpoints
python manage.py runserver

## sample curl request:
If you'd like to test the endpoints without using a browser this is an example request
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"from_floor": 2, "to_floor": 4}' -X POST localhost:8000/api/lift/request/

# run testing:
Running testing is pretty straight forwards, just run this command below and confirm all is working as intended
python manage.py test
